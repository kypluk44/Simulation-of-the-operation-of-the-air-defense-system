# Airdefence Game

Airdefence is a simple 2D game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. The objective of the game is to defend against enemy rockets by controlling an anti-aircraft gun.

## Game Features:

- **Player Control:** Use the 'A' and 'D' keys to rotate the anti-aircraft gun. Press the 'Space' key to fire bullets.
- **Physics Simulation:** Rockets and bullets follow basic physics principles, including velocity, acceleration, and air resistance.
- **Enemy Rockets:** Enemy rockets spawn at regular intervals and move towards the target. The player must shoot them down before they reach the target.
- **Radar System:** The game features a radar that periodically scans for nearby enemy rockets and provides information about their position and angle.

## How to Play:

1. Run the script in a Python environment with the Pygame library installed.
2. Use the 'A' and 'D' keys to rotate the anti-aircraft gun.
3. Press the 'Space' key to fire bullets and destroy incoming rockets.
4. Keep an eye on the radar for information about enemy rockets.
5. The game ends if an enemy rocket reaches the target.
